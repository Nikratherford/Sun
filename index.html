    <h2>Facts About Sun</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>The Sun accounts for 99.86% of the mass in the Solar System</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          It has a mass of around 330,000 times that of Earth. It is three quarters hydrogen and most of its remaining mass is helium.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>
          Over one million Earth's could fit inside the Sun
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          If you were to fill a hollow Sun with spherical Earths, somewhere around 960,000 would fit inside. However, if you squashed those Earths to ensure there was no wasted space then you could fit 1,300,000 Earths inside the Sun. The surface area of the Sun is 11,990 times that of Earth.
        </p>
      </li>

          <strong>
            One day the Sun will consume the Earth
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The Sun will continue to burn for about 130 million years after it burns through all of its hydrogen, instead burning helium. During this time it will expand to such a size that it will engulf Mercury, Venus, and Earth. When it reaches this point, it will have become a red giant star.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>
            The energy created by the Sun’s core is nuclear fusion
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          This huge amount of energy is produced when four hydrogen nuclei are combined into one helium nucleus.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>
            The Sun is almost a perfect sphere
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Considering the sheer size of the Sun, there is only a 10 km difference in its polar and equatorial diameters – this makes it the closest thing to a perfect sphere observed in nature.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>
            The Sun is travelling at 220 km per second
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          It is around 24,000-26,000 light-years from the galactic centre and it takes the Sun approximately 225-250 million years to complete one orbit of the centre of the Milky Way.
